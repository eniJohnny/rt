Major :
    - Reworked the threads to be able de manage multiples scenes at the same time
    - Instead of just the scene, new struct UIContext is now available everywhere in the UI : it contains every scene opened and a few contextual infos

Minor :
    - Removed some more unused commented code
    - Added the filters to the UI
    - Reorganized lib.rs constants a bit and removed some unused ones
    - Added one-sided property on rectangles which allows to see through it from one side and not the other
    - Divided the thread handling into smaller files/fonctions to make it more readable, especially with the new code added
